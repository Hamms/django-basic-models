def u_slugify(txt):
    """A custom version of slugify that retains non-ascii characters. The purpose of this
    function in the application is to make URLs more readable in a browser, so there are 
    some added heuristics to retain as much of the title meaning as possible while 
    excluding characters that are troublesome to read in URLs. For example, question marks 
    will be seen in the browser URL as %3F and are thereful unreadable. Although non-ascii
    characters will also be hex-encoded in the raw URL, most browsers will display them
    as human-readable glyphs in the address bar -- those should be kept in the slug."""
